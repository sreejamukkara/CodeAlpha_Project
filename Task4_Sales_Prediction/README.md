# Sales Prediction using Python

## Description
This project predicts future sales based on factors such as advertising spend,
target audience, and platform using machine learning techniques.

## Work Done
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Feature selection and transformation
- Model training using regression / forecasting techniques
- Evaluation of model performance

## Visualizations
- Sales trend analysis plots
- Advertising spend vs sales relationship
- Predicted vs actual sales comparison plots

## Model Explainability (SHAP)
SHAP were used to explain how different input features influenced
sales predictions, improving model transparency.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- SHAP

## Outcome
The model provides useful sales forecasts and actionable insights for
business decision-making.
