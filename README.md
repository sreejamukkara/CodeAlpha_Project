## Internship Duration
20th December 2025 – 20th January 2026

## Overview
This repository contains all the tasks completed as part of the CodeAlpha
Data Science Internship. The projects focus on data analysis, machine learning,
model evaluation, visualization, and explainability using Python.

## Tasks Completed

### Task 1: Iris Flower Classification
Built a machine learning classification model to predict Iris flower species.
Performed exploratory data analysis, visualization, model evaluation, and
explained predictions using SHAP.

### Task 2: Unemployment Analysis with Python
Analyzed unemployment rate data to identify trends and study the impact of
Covid-19 using data preprocessing and visualizations.

### Task 3: Car Price Prediction
Developed a regression model to predict car prices based on multiple features.
Included data preprocessing, EDA, visualization, and explainable AI techniques
using SHAP.

### Task 4: Sales Prediction
Predicted future sales based on advertising and business-related features.
Performed data analysis, visualization, model training, evaluation, and
interpretation of results.

## Technologies & Tools
- Python
- Google Colab
- Pandas
- NumPy

## How to Run the Projects
1. Open any task folder
2. Upload the `.ipynb` file to Google Colab
3. Upload the dataset when prompted
4. Run all cells sequentially

## Notes
Each task is organized in a separate folder with its own notebook and README
file for better clarity and understanding.
