# Car Price Prediction

## Description
This project uses machine learning regression techniques to predict car prices
based on various vehicle features such as mileage, horsepower, brand, and age.

## Work Done
- Data preprocessing and handling missing values
- Feature selection and transformation
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Model training using regression algorithms
- Model evaluation using performance metrics

## Visualizations
- Feature vs price relationship plots
- Correlation heatmaps
- Actual vs predicted price plots

## Model Explainability (SHAP)
SHAP were applied to interpret model predictions and understand
how different features contribute to the predicted car price.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- SHAP

## Outcome
Developed a regression model capable of predicting car prices with reasonable
accuracy and interpretable feature contributions.
