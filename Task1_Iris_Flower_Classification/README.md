# Iris Flower Classification

## Description
This project builds a machine learning classification model to identify Iris
flower species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) using flower measurements.

## Work Done
- Loaded and explored the Iris dataset
- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Visualized feature distributions and class separation
- Trained a classification model using Scikit-learn
- Evaluated model performance using accuracy and metrics

## Visualizations
- Feature distribution plots
- Pairwise relationships between features
- Class-wise comparison plots

## Model Explainability (SHAP)
SHAP were used to explain individual predictions by showing how
features such as petal length and petal width influenced the model’s decisions.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- SHAP

## Outcome
The model achieves good classification accuracy and provides interpretable
predictions through explainability techniques.
